This code is to give gerneral idea on how to draw (circle) on a video.

Instead of a video we can also use a webcam or an inbuilt camera of our laptop
for using live camera instead of video we have to just replace 'file path' with '0', so that the code will use your default camera.

example:

.......................
cv2.VideoCapture('20-Seconds Animation') or cv2.VideoCapture(0)
....................

#use to draw on camera with mouse
